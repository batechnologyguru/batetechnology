Check out any job board, and you'll find plenty of postings for Business Analysts. A quick search of LinkedIn shows over [43,000 active BA job postings on their job board](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?geoId=103644278&keywords=Business%20Analyst&location=United%20States). And that number is only expected to grow.

According to the [US Bureau of Labor Statistics,](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/management-analysts.htm) the number of BA jobs will grow by 11% in 2020. By 2028 it is expected that there will be almost 1,000,000 BA jobs in the USA alone, up from about 800,000 in 2020. To add to this good news story, they also reported that a Business Analyst's median salary in 2019 was almost $90k.

_While $90k /year is a good salary, it doesn't tell the whole story._

If you dig into the numbers a little further, you'll uncover something interesting: one large group of BAs earning in the $50k-$60k range and a smaller group making $100k+.

## Examining the Characteristics of High Paying Business Analyst Jobs

An excellent place to start investigating the difference in pay in BA jobs is on Dice.com. They just happened to have a list of the [Top 20 Business Analyst jobs](https://www.dice.com/jobs/q-Business+Analyst-jobs). When you start to look at some of these jobs, you'll notice that they're not asking for 20+ years of experience; often, one to two years of experience will do.

What they are asking for is technical skills:

* SQL
* JIRA
* Salesforce
* Data analysis
* Cloud computing
* Python
* RPA
* Prototyping
* and Tableau, to name a few

Nobody expects (or wants) business analysts to be programmers. Instead, employers need power users who can do some technical tasks and, more importantly, communicate effectively with technical personnel.

> Some organizations are beginning to call this a citizen programmer.

The demand for citizen programmers will continue to grow as more tools come on the market. When I first started in the BA field twenty years ago, you hardly need any technical skills. As long as you had a decent understanding of the Microsoft Office suite, that was about all you needed. 

The days of the non-technical BA are quickly coming to an end. Which raises the question, how do BAs go about getting the technical skills they require?

When you look around at the various training sites, there aren't many sites geared toward teaching BAs technical skills. Sites like Udemy and Pluralsight have tons of courses, but they are far too technical and delve into unnecessary details for non-programmers.
