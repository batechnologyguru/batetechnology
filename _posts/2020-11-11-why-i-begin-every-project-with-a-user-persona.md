I begin all my projects with the development of a user persona. It’s not always a popular decision with clients, but this is one area where I don’t budge. Personas are a vital component of a successful software development project.

Personas were first popularized in the 1990s by marketing guru Geoffrey Moore in his book Crossing the Chasm. He describes a persona as a representation of the goals and behaviours of a hypothesized group of users. 

Well, that’s a little too academic for me.

I prefer to think of a user persona only as of the ‘poster child’ for the application. This semi-fictional character represents the most common characteristics of your target user base. Here’s a persona that I created for my site BA School Online:

Since you’re reading this article on the BA School Online site, I sure hope it somewhat describes you.

How do I develop a user persona?

The best way to develop a user persona is to talk to your target users, ideally in a structured interview format. It usually takes between 15 and 30 minutes to run through a standard set of questions on topics like background, demographics, goals, and values. 

Be forewarned, you’ll probably have to offer participants an Amazon gift card or something similar. I usually provide $25 and expect about 30 minutes from the user, so it’s a decent incentive for them. Depending on your audience, you may be able to get away with less.

If you can’t talk to your users in person or over the phone, surveys are also a good second option. They have the added benefit of providing the data back to you in a structured format, which makes it really easy to compile. If you’re looking for a survey tool, SurveyMonkey is the de facto standard, but there are others. 

Common items to include in a persona are: demographics, preferences, behaviors, goals, and motivations. 

Not everybody loves the user persona approach 

As useful as they are, persona development is usually met with resistance at the client site. I’m not sure why this is the case, but it seems to happens every time. Clients just don’t like creating them. 

Whatever the case, be prepared for common complaints when you propose the creation of a user persona: 

•    Too fluffy

•    We already know our customers  

•    No time

•    We’ll need dozens of personas 

Some of these are complaints hold water, especially if your persona is not properly constructed. You need to make sure that your persona development is goal oriented and produces a solid result. 

Some common pitfalls to watch out for when developing a user persona:

•    Doing too much with one user persona. The target persona should be the poster child for the application.  Don’t make it look like it was designed by a committee. Be bold. Be opinionated.

•    Getting too detailed. If you’re spending hours searching for a photo or debating minute details, you’re doing it wrong. There is no such thing as a perfect prototype. 

•    Creating multiple personas. Focus on your ‘poster child’ persona to start. There will be time in the future to develop additional personas, if the first one goes well.

Personas provide tremendous insight for business analysts during requirements gather and solution design. A detailed user persona will help you determine where to focus your time, guide product development, and allow for alignment across the organization. 

In the next article, I’ll demonstrate how to create a user persona for the GrubBox case study.
