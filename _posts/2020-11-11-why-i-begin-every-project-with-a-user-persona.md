I begin all my business analysis projects with the development of a User Persona. It's not always a popular decision. Many clients view this as a 'fluff activity.' But this is one area where I don't budge.

Personas are a vital component of any successful business analysis project. They focus efforts and help to ensure your solutions meeting the users' needs.

## What is a persona?

Personas were first popularized in the 1990s by marketing guru [Geoffrey Moore in his book Crossing the Chasm](http://www.geoffreyamoore.com/). He describes a persona as:

> A persona is a representation of the goals and behaviours of a hypothesized group of users - Geoffrey Moore

Well, that's a little too academic for me.

I prefer to think of a persona as the _'poster child'_ for the application. This semi-fictional character represents the most common characteristics of your target user base.

Here is the persona I created for BA Technology Guru:

Since you're reading this article on the BA Technology Guru site, I sure hope it somewhat describes you. I have found it very helpful when developing courses, blog articles, and other resources to keep this fictional person in mind. It helps me ensure I'm creating materials for the target audience, not for my personal preferences.

## How do you develop a user persona?

The best way to develop a user persona is to talk to your target users, ideally in a structured interview format. It usually takes between 15 and 30 minutes to run through a standard set of questions on topics like background, demographics, goals, and values.

Be forewarned; you'll probably have to offer participants an Amazon gift card or something similar. I usually provide $25 and expect about 30 minutes from the user, so it's a decent incentive for them. Depending on your audience, you may be able to get away with less.

If you can't talk to your users in person or over the phone, surveys are also an excellent second option. They have the added benefit of providing the data back to you in a structured format, making it easy to compile. If you're looking for a survey tool, [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/) is the de facto standard. It's free and easy to use.

Items to include in a persona are: demographics, preferences, behaviours, goals, and motivations.

## Not everybody loves personas.

As useful as they are, clients sometimes resist persona development. I'm not sure why this is the case, but it occurs fairly frequently. Whatever the case, be prepared for common complaints when you propose the creation of a user persona:

* Too fluffy
* We already know our customers
* No time
* We'll need dozens of personas
* Personas are for marketing, not business analysis

Some of these are complaints are valid. You need to make sure that your persona development is goal-oriented and produces a tangible result. Poorly constructed personas can be worse than no persona at all.

Some common pitfalls to watch out for when developing a user persona:

* **Persona is too broad.** The target persona should be the poster child for the application. Please don't make it look like a committee designed it. Be bold. Be opinionated.
* **Persona has too much detail**. If you're spending hours searching for a photo or debating minute details, you're doing it wrong. There is no such thing as a perfect prototype.
* **Avoid the temptation to create multiple personas.** Focus on your 'poster child' persona to start. There will be a time in the future to develop additional personas if the first one goes well.

Personas provide tremendous insight for business analysts during requirements gather and solution design. A detailed user persona will help you determine where to focus your time, guide product development, and allow for alignment across the organization.
